Open ``vmap`` in [Hammer](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor_(Source_2)), install through Steam.

Commit your changes as new file with a timestamp, ``de_pk_241002_22_32.vmap``, to not overwrite someone elses current work. Also make a copy and replace ``de_pk.vmap``.

# Publish on workshop/server
Publish the map through Workshop Manager in Hammer. Make sure to build the map first. When publishing, select visibility hidden. 

When published, change map visibility to "unlisted" in Steam, if you dont do this, the server will not be able to download the latest version of the map.
