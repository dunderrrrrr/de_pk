# PK CS2 MAP

[compiled version for commit d4a2273](https://filebin.net/0w5wutkjp3cexskf/de_pk_compiled.zip)

This is a work in progress, probably always will be.  

Scale is pretty bad. Lightning is pretty bad. Overall map design, 10/10, would play. See you in Valve Major Championships, baby.

# Contribute

Open ``vmap`` in [Hammer](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor_(Source_2)), install through Steam.

Commit your changes as new file with a timestamp, ``de_pk_241002_22_32.vmap``, to not overwrite someone elses current work. Also make a copy and replace ``de_pk.vmap``.

# Publish on workshop/server
Publish the map through Workshop Manager in Hammer. Make sure to build the map first. When publishing, select visibility hidden. 

When published, change map visibility to "unlisted" in Steam, if you dont do this, the server will not be able to download the latest version of the map.
